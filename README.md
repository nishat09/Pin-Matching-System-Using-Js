# Pin-Matching-System-Using-Js
In this project, I have made a simple pin matching system using JS. User can generate a random 4 digit pin by clicking a button, after that user can input the pin to see if it matches with the generated pin. User will have 3 attempts to input the correct pin. If he fails to do so, the system will generate an error page
